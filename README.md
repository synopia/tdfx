tdfx - a tower defence engine using javafx
====

After playing around with javafx I came up with this.

I call this an engine, because the actual game logic is encoded using [json/gson](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/).

The used tower defence model is tightly coupled to the well known warcraft 3 td maps. So the damage system is based on my observations of playing such maps for too long time.
